# CS-370-Portfolio

# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The goal of this project was to create an intelligent player agent that could navigate efficiently through a maze to retrieve the treasure before the other player. The opponent player is not currently integrated into the game. We were given some starter code that set up the environment, rewards/penalties, movement controls, etc. My job was to implement a Q-learning algorithm to solve the problem.

# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists work to find solutions to problems by designing, analyzing, and developing software/hardware. This is important because this new software can provide great utility and quality of life improvements such as speeding up job hiring processes, performing experimental tests and surgery in a safe virtual environment using AI, and using natural language processing models to gain information and knowledge.

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
When approaching a problem as a computer scientist, I first try to determine what needs to be solved and how the program should function. What are the needs of the user and how can I satisfy those needs with technology?

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibility to the end user and the organization is to produce software that is free from harmful bias and thoroughly tested. I should be open to getting multiple perspectives and feedback when developing any model. I will continuously review and update the model so that it does not produce outdated and inaccurate results.
